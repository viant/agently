Update the current task plan with a clear explanation and concise steps.

Inputs
- name: "update_plan"
- call_id: correlation id (optional)
- arguments: stringified JSON object with fields:
  {"explanation":"...","plan":[{"step":"...","status":"pending|in_progress|completed"}, ...]}

Plan Item
- step: short (≈5–7 words), one sentence.
- status: pending | in_progress | completed.
- rule: at most one step can be in_progress at any time.

Behavior
- Validates arguments JSON and statuses.
- Echoes back call_id, explanation, and normalized plan.
- Returns an error on invalid input (no partial updates).

When To Use
- Non-trivial, multi-step, or ambiguous work.
- User explicitly requests TODOs/plan.
- You generate new steps mid-task and want alignment.

How To Update
- Mark finished steps completed.
- Set exactly one next step to in_progress.
- You may complete multiple steps at once.
- If everything is done, mark all completed.

Don’ts
- Don’t use for simple, single-step queries.
- Don’t pad with filler or redundant steps.

After Calling
- Don’t repeat the full plan verbatim in your reply.
- Summarize the change and highlight the next step.

Example
- arguments:
  {"explanation":"High-level release plan","plan":[{"step":"Write release notes","status":"in_progress"},{"step":"Bump versions","status":"pending"},{"step":"Tag and publish","status":"pending"}]}
