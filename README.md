# Agently

Agently is a Go framework for building and interacting with AI agents. It provides a flexible and extensible platform for creating, managing, and communicating with AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Features

- **Agent-based Architecture**: Create and manage AI agents with different capabilities and personalities
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Integrate with various LLM providers including OpenAI, Vertex AI, Bedrock, and more
- **Conversation Management**: Maintain conversation history and context across interactions
- **Tool Integration**: Extend agent capabilities with custom tools
- **Embeddings**: Support for text embeddings for semantic search and retrieval
- **CLI Interface**: Interact with agents through a command-line interface
- **HTTP Server**: Deploy agents as web services
- **Orchestration (Decoupled)**: Agent turns are executed without a Fluxor runtime. MCP tools and internal services are coordinated directly by Agently.

### Agent Tools (v2)

Agently exposes a consolidated tool surface for agent selection and execution:

- `llm/agents:list` – returns a small, filtered directory of agents (internal and external) with `{id, name, description, tags, priority}`. Only agents with `directory.enabled: true` are listed; external entries are configured under `directory.external`.
- `llm/agents:run` – runs an agent by `agentId` with an `objective` and optional `context`. Conversation, turn, and user are derived from request context; the runtime publishes status and links parent/child conversations (when enabled in policy).

Backwards compatibility: `llm/exec:run_agent` remains available but is deprecated. Prefer `llm/agents:run` going forward.

Configuration hints:
- Internal agents may opt‑in to the directory with:
  ```yaml
  directory:
    enabled: true
    name: "Coder"
    description: "Generate and refactor code"
    tags: ["code","refactor"]
    priority: 80
  ```
- External A2A agents can be added to the directory via executor config:
  ```yaml
  a2aClients:
    - name: ext-researcher
      jsonrpcURL: https://ext.example.com/v1/jsonrpc
      streamURL:  https://ext.example.com/a2a
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer ${A2A_TOKEN}
      streamingDefault: true
  directory:
    external:
      - id: researcher
        clientRef: ext-researcher
        name: Researcher
        description: "Find, read and summarize web sources"
        tags: ["research","web"]
        priority: 70
  ```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.x or higher

### Installing

```bash
go get github.com/viant/agently
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/viant/agently.git
cd agently/agently

# Set the Agently root directory (defaults to ~/.agently if not set)
export AGENTLY_ROOT=./agently_workspace

# Create the directory
mkdir -p $AGENTLY_ROOT

# Build the application
go build -o agently .

# Check available commands
./agently -h


# Start a agently webservice on :8080 port
./agently serve

# Start a chat cli session
./agently chat
```

### How to run MCP server
To run an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with SQLKit support:

```bash
# Clone the MCP SQLKit repository
git clone https://github.com/viant/mcp-sqlkit.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd mcp-sqlkit

# Start the MCP server on port 5000
go run ./cmd/mcp-sqlkit -a :5000
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:5000 and can be used with Agently for database operations.

### Quick Start with MCP server and sqlkit tool

This guide will help you set up Agently with the MCP server and SQLKit tool for database operations.

#### Prerequisites
- Complete the Quick Start steps above to set up Agently
- Have a MySQL server running (this example uses a local MySQL server)

#### Step 1: Configure the MCP Server
1. First, ensure both Agently and any running MCP servers are stopped.

2. Create the MCP configuration file:
```bash
# Create the mcp directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $AGENTLY_ROOT/mcp

# Create the SQLKit configuration file
cat > $AGENTLY_ROOT/mcp/sqlkit.yaml << EOF
name: sqlkit
version: ""
protocol: ""
namespace: ""
transport:
    type: sse
    command: ""
    arguments: []
    url: http://localhost:5000
auth: null
EOF
```

#### Step 2: Configure the Agent to Use SQLKit
Update your agent configuration to include the SQLKit tool:

```bash
# Create or update the chat agent configuration
mkdir -p $AGENTLY_ROOT/agents
cat > $AGENTLY_ROOT/agents/chatter.yaml << EOF
description: Default conversational agent
id: chat
modelRef: openai_o4-mini
name: Chat
orchestrationFlow: workflow/orchestration.yaml
temperature: 0
tool:
  - pattern: system/exec
  - pattern: sqlkit
knowledge:
  - url: knowledge/
EOF
```

#### Step 3: Start the Services
1. Start the MCP server with SQLKit (follow the "How to run MCP server" steps above)
2. Start Agently (run `./agently chat`)

#### Step 4: Test Database Connectivity
Ensure your MySQL server is running. For this example, we assume:
```
port: 3306
user: root
password: dev
database: my_db
```

#### Step 5: Query Your Database
Send a query to test the database connection:
```
> tell how many tables do we have in my_db db?
```

A configuration wizard will guide you through setting up the MySQL connector:
1. When prompted for connector name, enter: `dev`
2. For driver, enter: `mysql`
3. For host, enter: `localhost`
4. For connector name, accept the default: `dev`
5. For port, enter your MySQL port (e.g., `3306`)
6. For project, just press Enter to skip (not needed for MySQL)
7. For DB/Dataset, enter: `my_db`
8. For flowURI:

   8.1 open given link in browser and submit user and password (e.g., `root` and `dev`)

   8.2 enter any value or accept the default

After configuration, Agently will execute your query and return the result, such as:
```
There are 340 base tables in the my_db schema when accessed via the dev connector.
```

You can now use natural language to query your database through Agently!

## Usage

### Match Defaults (auto full vs match)

You can control auto full vs match behavior and result capping via a single default in your workspace config:

```yaml
default:
  match:
    # Used when a knowledge/MCP entry doesn't specify maxFiles.
    # Also drives the auto decision: if a location has more files than this,
    # the runtime switches to Embedius match; otherwise it loads files directly (full).
    maxFiles: 5
```

Notes:
- minScore (when provided on a knowledge/MCP entry) only filters results in match mode; it does not force match mode.
- URIs are normalized (TrimPath) for stable references and better token caching.
- System documents are injected as separate system messages (content only) and are not rendered in system.tmpl to avoid duplication.

### HTTP API (v1)

The embedded server exposes a simple chat API under `/v1/api`:

- Create a conversation:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/api/conversations | jq
  # { "status": "ok", "data": { "id": "..." } }
  ```

- Post a message to a conversation:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"text":"Hello"}' \
    http://localhost:8080/v1/api/conversations/CONV_ID/messages | jq
  ```

- Get conversation messages and status:
  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/api/conversations/CONV_ID/messages | jq
  ```

- Fetch payload bytes (e.g., attachments or large LLM outputs):
  ```bash
  # raw bytes (204 when empty)
  curl -s -L 'http://localhost:8080/v1/api/payload/PAYLOAD_ID?raw=1' > body.bin

  # JSON envelope without inline body
  curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/v1/api/payload/PAYLOAD_ID?meta=1' | jq
  ```

### Configuration (environment variables)

- `AGENTLY_DB_DRIVER` and `AGENTLY_DB_DSN`: optional SQL connector for persistence
  - Examples:
    - SQLite: `AGENTLY_DB_DRIVER=sqlite`, `AGENTLY_DB_DSN=file:/path/to/db.sqlite?cache=shared`
    - Postgres: `AGENTLY_DB_DRIVER=postgres`, `AGENTLY_DB_DSN=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=disable`
  - When unset, Agently falls back to a local SQLite database under `$AGENTLY_ROOT/db/agently.db`.

- `AGENTLY_REDACT_KEYS`: comma-separated list of JSON keys to scrub from payload snapshots
  - Default: `api_key,apikey,authorization,auth,password,passwd,secret,token,bearer,client_secret`
  - Example: `AGENTLY_REDACT_KEYS=apiKey,Authorization,password`

### Command Line Interface

Agently provides a command-line interface for interacting with agents:

```bash
# Chat with an agent
agently chat 

# Chat with an agent with a specific query
agently chat -l <agent-location> -q "Your query here"

# Continue a conversation
agently chat -l <agent-location> -c <conversation-id>

# List existing conversations
agently list

# Manage MCP servers
agently mcp list                         # view configured servers
agently mcp add   -n local -t stdio \
  --command "my-mcp" --arg "--flag"
agently mcp add   -n cloud -t sse   --url https://mcp.example.com/sse
agently mcp remove -n local

# List available tools (names & descriptions)
agently list-tools

# Show full JSON definition for a tool
agently list-tools -n system/exec.execute --json

# Run an agentic workflow from JSON input
agently run -i <input-file>

# Start HTTP server
agently serve

# Workspace management (new)

Agently stores all editable resources under **`$AGENTLY_ROOT`** (defaults to
`~/.agently`).  Each kind has its own sub-folder:


~/.agently/
  agents/      # *.yaml agent definitions
  models/      # LLM or embedder configs
  workflows/   # (deprecated)
  mcp/         # MCP client definitions
```

Use the generic `ws` command group to list, add or remove any resource kind:

```bash
# List agents
agently ws list   -k agent

# Add a model from file
agently ws add    -k model   -n gpt4o -f gpt4o.yaml

# Get raw YAML for workflow
agently ws get    -k workflow -n plan_exec_finish

# Delete MCP server definition
agently ws remove -k mcp -n local
```

### Clearing agents cache
1. Close all running agents.
2. Delete content of ~/.emb

### Model convenience helpers

```bash
# Switch default model for an agent
agently model-switch -a chat -m gpt4o

# Reset agent to inherit executor default
agently model-reset  -a chat
```

### MCP helpers (now stored in workspace)

```bash
# Add/update server definition (stored as ~/.agently/mcp/local.yaml)
agently mcp add    -n local -t stdio --command my-mcp

# List names or full JSON objects (with --json)
agently mcp list   [--json]

# Remove definition
agently mcp remove -n local
```
```

## Forge UI

Agently embeds a Forge-based web UI with data-driven menus and windows.

- Endpoints:
  - `GET /v1/workspace/metadata` — aggregated workspace metadata (defaults, agents, tools, models). Used by windows to populate forms and menus.
  - `GET /v1/api/agently/forge/*` — serves embedded Forge metadata (navigation and window definitions) from `metadata/`.

- Navigation pattern (`metadata/navigation.yaml`):
  - Define a menu node and point `windowKey` to a window definition under `metadata/window/...`.

  Example:
  ```yaml
  - id: tools
    label: Tools
    icon: function
    childNodes:
      - id: list
        label: Catalogue
        icon: list
        windowKey: tool
        windowTitle: Tools
  ```

- Window pattern (`metadata/window/<name>/...yaml`):
  - Windows can declare a datasource pointing to the aggregated metadata endpoint.

  Example (datasource):
  ```yaml
  service:
    endpoint: agentlyAPI
    uri: /v1/workspace/metadata
    method: GET

  selectors:
    data: data
  ```

Customize menus by editing `metadata/navigation.yaml` and add new windows under `metadata/window/`. The server automatically serves these via `/v1/api/agently/forge/`.

### Options

### Templated agent queries (velty)

Agently supports rendering prompts with the velty template engine so you can
compose rich queries from structured inputs.

Where you can use templates:
- Agent prompts can be templated (Velty). Templates render with variables:
  - Prompt – the original query string
  - everything from context – each key becomes a template variable

Example (templated prompt):

```
query: "Initial feature brief"
queryTemplate: |
  Design this feature based on:\n
  Brief: ${Prompt}\n
  Product: ${productName}\n
  Constraints: ${constraints}
context:
  productName: "Acme WebApp"
  constraints: "Ship MVP in 2 sprints"
```

In addition, the core generation service uses the same unified templating for
Template (with ${Prompt}) and SystemTemplate (with ${SystemPrompt}) together
with any values placed in Bind.

- `-f, --config`: Executor config YAML/JSON path
- `-l, --location`: Agent definition path
- `-q, --query`: User query
- `-c, --conv`: Conversation ID (optional)
- `-p, --policy`: Tool policy: auto|ask|deny (default: auto)
- `-t, --timeout`: Timeout in seconds for the agent response (0=none)
- `--log`: Unified log (LLM, TOOL, TASK) (default: agently.log)

#### mcp list / add / remove

- `mcp list` — lists configured servers. `--json` to output full objects.

- `mcp add` flags:
  - `-n, --name`  – unique identifier
  - `-t, --type`  – transport: `stdio`, `sse`, or `streaming`
  - `--command`   – stdio command (when `-t stdio`)
  - `--arg`       – repeatable extra arguments for stdio (when `-t stdio`)
  - `--url`       – HTTP endpoint (when `-t sse|streaming`)

- `mcp remove` flags:
  - `-n, --name`  – identifier to delete

#### list-tools

- `-n, --name` – Tool name (`service/method`) to display full schema
- `--json` – Print tool definitions in JSON (applies to single or all tools)

#### exec

- `-n, --name` – Tool name to execute
- `-i, --input` – Inline JSON arguments (object)
- `-f, --file` – Path to JSON file with arguments (use `-` for STDIN)
- `--timeout` – Seconds to wait for completion (default 120)
- `--json` – Print result as JSON

Example (properly quoted for Bash/Zsh):

```bash
./agently exec -n system/exec.execute \
  -i '{"commands":["echo '\''hello'\''"]}'
```

### Tool-Call Timeout Default

Set a default per-tool execution timeout in your workspace config:

```yaml
default:
  # Seconds to allow each tool call before it is canceled.
  toolCallTimeoutSec: 180
  # Optional: seconds to wait for elicitation (assistant/tool) before auto-decline.
  elicitationTimeoutSec: 120
```

- The agent layer applies these values per turn.
- You can still override tool timeouts via env `AGENTLY_TOOLCALL_TIMEOUT` for ad‑hoc runs; the workspace default takes precedence when present.
