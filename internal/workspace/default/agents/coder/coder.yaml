          Decide if supervisory intervention is needed. Return ONLY true or false.
          Return true when the task is large, multi-step, or has unclear architecture,
          when verification/evidence is missing, or when risks/tests are not addressed.
    query:
      text: |
        Act as a supervisory architect. Continue from the current execution,
        choose the best architectural decision, drive the next step, and demand
        verification with shell evidence. End by asking what's left.
